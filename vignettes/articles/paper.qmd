## Summary

Git has a challenging learning curve, but it is crucial for both individual and team software development practices to have a good command of a wide set of Git features beyond the basics. 
Saperlipopette is an open-source, MIT-licensed R package (library) aimed at providing hands-on, low-stakes practice opportunities for Git users to improve their version control skills. 
It has been used in several training sessions, online and in person, in English, French and Spanish. 
While saperlipopette is best suited for R users, the approach of launching exercises through a single command, creating a (temporary) folder with a Git playground, providing instructions and hints, could be-reused for creating a library or CLI in any language. 
Even the actual scenarios and guidance could be re-used and ported to another language.

## Statement of need

Competent use of version control software improves the software development productivity of individuals and teams by enabling them to work on different features simultaneously while carefully tracking the project history. 
Improving one’s version control skills beyond the basics quickly pays off in time gains, for instance by using dedicated commands to undo changes instead of manually deleting and copy-pasting. 
It also reduces the risks of losing work as one knows how to avoid mistakes and how to recover from them. Among version control tools, Git is the most popular one; furthermore, a huge part of the world’s open-source software development happens on GitHub, and to a lesser extent on GitLab and Codeberg, which all use Git. 
However, Git is notoriously confusing and difficult to learn [@Sharma_2025], which makes upskilling potentially daunting. 

In an effort to address this issue, we developed an R package, saperlipopette [https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/](https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/), as a tool for locally practicing advanced Git commands, which are not usually taught at beginners workshops. 
The target audience of saperlipopette consists of professionals developing software who usually work with R and know basic Git commands such as add, commit, push, and pull, and who understand a bit about branches, but are not yet fluent, and therefore underuse Git’s palette of features. 

The package is suitable for instructors to use as a safe practice environment during workshops when live-coding and running hands-on exercises, as well for for self-guided learners.

## Design of the software

With our software, we provide learners with a dozen exercises which are each focussed on a realistic and useful scenario, such as undoing a change or using Git’s time machine to repair a project, and which are each recreated in a small throw-away directory. 
Therefore, users of our teaching tool can realistically practice new-to-them, more advanced Git commands without endangering their work nor having to think of how to artificially create a practice scenario for themselves. 
This workflow is based on active learning pedagogical strategies of working on authentic tasks, with guided practice. 

![Diagram showing how saperlipopette is used. The saperlipopette R package contains functions such as `exo_time_machine()` and `exo_undo_commit()`. A call to a function like `exo_time_machine()` creates a temporary folder with a ready-made Git situation, from which one launches a new R session. In that folder, the user reads the instructions in R, and works on the Git challenge using the tools of their choice. A new call to the `exo_time_machine()` function would create yet another folder with the exact same exercise, making it easy to restart and repeat as needed.](jose.png){fig-alt=""}

Furthermore, the exercises are local, meaning users can practice on their machines, with the tools they are already familiar with or are trying to become familiar with: Git on the command line, Git with an interface such as RStudio IDE or Positron IDE, or other general-purpose Git clients. 
Recreating an exercise is only ever an R function call away, so users can practice anytime they want, even getting a refresher on a command before applying it to their real work project as scaffolding strategy. 
This approach helps reduce the learners’ cognitive load. 

Importantly, our software provides two levels of guidance for each exercise: a general description of the problem to be solved, with the option to request more hints if necessary. 

Moreover, the messages of the functions, that is to say the exercises and their hints, are available in three languages: English, Spanish and French. 

Lastly, from a trainer’s perspective, saperlipopette’s ready-made exercises can save time in demonstrating Git workflows.

## Pedagogical content of the software

Functions, therefore exercises, are organized in three categories in the package’s online reference index: “Tools to check your set up”, “Exercises inspired from Oh shit Git\!”, “Other exercises”. The documentation for each exercise states which Git commands it uses. 
One could type “reset” in the search bar of the [documentation website](https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/) to find the relevant exercise(s).

Table 1\. Overview of the Git scenarios, main concepts and commands covered in *saperlipopette*

| Scenario | Main Git concepts | Git commands typically taught |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Go back in time | Commit history, HEAD movement, recovering lost states | git reset, git reflog |
| Fix an accidental commit to main | Branch pointers, rewriting history, moving commits | git reset \--hard, git branch, git switch, git checkout |
| Fix a commit on the wrong branch | Applying commits across branches, history manipulation | git cherry-pick, git reset, git switch, git checkout |
| Change the last commit message | Amending commits, metadata editing | git commit \--amend |
| Add a small fix to the last commit | Amending content without changing metadata | git commit \--amend \--no-edit |
| Undo an older commit | Commit history inspection, safe undo with new commits | git log, git revert |
| Discard changes in a file | Restoring file state, working tree vs commit history | git log, git restore, git checkout, git commit |
| Split changes into multiple commits | Partial staging, atomic commits | git add \--patch, git add \-p |
| Remove untracked files | Cleaning the working directory, untracked files | git clean |
| Experience merge conflicts | Branch merging, conflict detection and resolution | git merge |
| Clean up commit history | History rewriting, interactive rebase | git rebase \-i |
| Start over from scratch | Resetting the index, unstaging changes | git reset \--mixed |
| Find the commit that introduced a bug | Binary search in commit history | git bisect |

In workshops, we select exercises to comply with the learning objectives. 
We use an informative slidedeck to provide context and explain concepts. 
We demonstrate exercises using live coding, then have participants solve them. 
In online workshops, we group participants in breakout rooms to foster collaborations and peer-instruction. 
After each practice time, and before moving on to the next topic, we discuss participants’ questions and remarks about the exercise(s) they have just worked on. 
In online workshops we encourage participants to share their screen and solve any question with all the class working together.

## Experience of use in teaching and learning situations

Two training curricula using the package were developed: one about reasons for and ways of creating a clean Git history; one about fixing common Git mishaps. 
The latter mostly follows the structure of the Oh Shit, Git\! Website: for instance a part is about fixing the last commit’s content or message. 
The former ties together the practice of basic commands such as Git commit –amend with more advanced techniques such as Git rebase \-i. 
Both curricula rely heavily on demonstrations and practice through the saperlipopette R package. 

Both curricula have been used in 1-hour to 2-hours workshops, in person and online. [@salmon_2026_18457383,@salmon_2026_18457425,@salmon_2026_18457460,@salmon_2026_18457484] 
They have been part of conferences, user groups and rOpenSci Champions Program Training. 
In feedback collected after teaching, students appreciated the hands-on approach and easy set up of saperlipopette exercises.

The multilingual feature improves its effectiveness in teaching and learning situations. 
Presenting exercises and feedback in learners’ native languages reduces cognitive load and allows them to focus on understanding Git concepts rather than translating technical English. 
For instructors, multilingual support enables reuse of the same materials across courses, workshops, and regions increasing reach and saving time on preparing exercises and materials.

## Story of the project

The R package was created by Maëlle Salmon after she read the “Git in Practice” book [@mcquaid2014] and the “Oh Shit, Git\!” website [@sylormiller], to bridge the gap between knowing about techniques and applying them in day-to-day work. 
The package’s initial set of functions covered “Oh Shit, Git”, which inspired the package name: “saperlipopette” is an old-fashioned curse word in French, Maëlle Salmon’s native language.  
Yanina Bellini Saibene helped to develop the training curricula and workshops instructional strategy to use it on the rOpenSci Champions Program Training after the need for more advanced Git training. 
Both authors have translated the exercises and training materials to their native languages and taught with the material together in several scenarios.

The package uses the gert [@gert] and usethis [@usethis] packages under the hood.
